In network programming, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a fundamental protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to create both a TCP client and server in Golang, from scratch. This tutorial is designed to take you step-by-step through the process, providing code samples and explanations for each part.

## Introduction to TCP in Golang

TCP is a protocol that allows two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. It ensures that data is delivered in order and without errors. Golang provides excellent support for TCP networking via its `net` package, making it straightforward to create both clients and servers.

### Key Concepts

- **TCP Server**: A program that listens for incoming TCP connections on a specific port.
- **TCP Client**: A program that establishes a connection to a TCP server to send and receive data.
- **Connection**: A two-way communication link established between the client and server.
- **Listener**: An object that waits for incoming connections on a specified network address.

## Creating a TCP Server

### Writing the Server Code

To create a TCP server in Golang, we will use the `net` package to listen for connections on a specific port and handle incoming data.

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
)

func handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
    defer conn.Close()
    fmt.Printf("Client connected: %s\n", conn.RemoteAddr().String())
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(conn)

    for scanner.Scan() {
        message := scanner.Text()
        fmt.Printf("Received: %s\n", message)
        conn.Write([]byte("Echo: " + message + "\n"))
    }

    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading from connection:", err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Client disconnected: %s\n", conn.RemoteAddr().String())
}

func main() {
    listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    defer listener.Close()

    fmt.Println("TCP server listening on port 8080")
    for {
        conn, err := listener.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error accepting connection:", err)
            continue
        }
        go handleConnection(conn)
    }
}
```

In this code:

- We create a TCP listener that listens on port 8080.
- `handleConnection` is a function that handles communication with a connected client.
- The server reads data from the client, echoes it back, and logs the interaction.

### Running the Server

Save the code to a file, say `server.go`, and run it using the following command:

```sh
go run server.go
```

You should see the server listening on port 8080, ready to accept connections.

## Creating a TCP Client

### Writing the Client Code

The TCP client will connect to the server, send data, and receive the response.

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:8080")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error connecting to server:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    defer conn.Close()

    fmt.Println("Connected to server. Type messages and press enter:")
    reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

    for {
        fmt.Print("Message: ")
        message, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
        conn.Write([]byte(message))

        response, _ := bufio.NewReader(conn).ReadString('\n')
        fmt.Println("Server response:", response)
    }
}
```

In this client code:

- We connect to the server running on `localhost` on port 8080.
- The client reads input from the user, sends it to the server, and prints the server's response.

### Running the Client

Save the client code to a file, say `client.go`, and run it using the following command:

```bash
go run client.go
```

You should see a prompt to enter messages, which will be sent to the server. The server’s response will be printed on the client console.

## Client-Server Interaction

Now that both the server and client are running, you can test the interaction:

1. Start the server.
2. Run the client.
3. Type messages into the client and observe them being echoed back by the server.

For example:

```
Server console:
TCP server listening on port 8080
Client connected: 127.0.0.1:52685
Received: Hello, server!
Client disconnected: 127.0.0.1:52685

Client console:
Connected to server. Type messages and press enter:
Message: Hello, server!
Server response: Echo: Hello, server!
```

## Handling Multiple Clients

To handle multiple clients concurrently, you can spawn a new goroutine for each connection.

```go
// Existing server code...

func main() {
    listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    defer listener.Close()

    fmt.Println("TCP server listening on port 8080")
    for {
        conn, err := listener.Accept()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error accepting connection:", err)
            continue
        }
        go handleConnection(conn) // Handle each connection in a new goroutine
    }
}
```

With this setup, the server can handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking on a single connection.

## Graceful Shutdown and Error Handling

It’s important to handle errors gracefully and ensure the server can shut down cleanly.

### Example: Handling Interrupt Signals

We can capture OS signals to handle a graceful shutdown:

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
    "os/signal"
    "syscall"
)

func handleConnection(conn net.Conn) {
    defer conn.Close()
    fmt.Printf("Client connected: %s\n", conn.RemoteAddr().String())
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(conn)

    for scanner.Scan() {
        message := scanner.Text()
        fmt.Printf("Received: %s\n", message)
        conn.Write([]byte("Echo: " + message + "\n"))
    }

    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading from connection:", err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Client disconnected: %s\n", conn.RemoteAddr().String())
}

func main() {
    listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error starting server:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    defer listener.Close()

    fmt.Println("TCP server listening on port 8080")

    // Channel to capture interrupt signals
    stop := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
    signal.Notify(stop, syscall.SIGINT, syscall.SIGTERM)

    go func() {
        for {
            conn, err := listener.Accept()
            if err != nil {
                fmt.Println("Error accepting connection:", err)
                continue
            }
            go handleConnection(conn)
        }
    }()

    <-stop
    fmt.Println("Shutting down server...")
}
```

In this example:

- We set up a channel to capture `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` signals.
- When a signal is received, the server shuts down gracefully.
